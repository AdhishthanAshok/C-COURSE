console.log("Hello"); // semocolon may or may not be written;
const num = 1445;
let a = "This is a";
var b = "Email"; // Prefer to not to use var , because of issue in block scope  and functional scope   --> still used in old js
c = "Why this is printing"; //  not a good way , but works
let d; //  --> Assign to Undefined
console.table([num, a, b, c, d]); // Prints all in a table format
